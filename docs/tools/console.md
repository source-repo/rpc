# The console

```
source-rpc console --broker mqtt://localhost:1883      # an MQTT network
source-rpc console --hub http://hub:7843               # a socket.io network
source-rpc console --broker mqtt://... --hub http://... # both at once
```

Opens a console at `http://127.0.0.1:7844`. Its primary workspace is one Network DataProvider:
the tree scopes across peers, components, resources and provider-owned branches, while the grid
shows every leaf in that scope. Network-wide destinations—Traffic, Problems, Presence and this
page's Operations—live beside Network in the left menu and use the main workspace. Actions, events
and peer chat stay in the contextual panel on the right.

Each described peer also contributes an **Interfaces** resource. Its RPC namespaces are branches
carrying description metadata (including implemented capabilities), and its methods are the leaves
shown in the same grid. A method row keeps named argument types, its return type, semantics, effect
and authority requirement together; arguments are not separate leaves, so a method with no
arguments remains visible and selectable. This resource is answered from the peer's cached
`describe()` result and opening a method preview does not call the method.
The resource also has a **Transports** branch. Each transport is a descriptive leaf carrying its
protocol, role and public endpoint when known. It has no Call action, and descriptions omit live
connection state, credentials and connection options.
Each method row has a **call** action. It opens that method in the contextual Actions panel with the
same typed arguments, confirmation rules, presets, timings, copy-as-CLI command, idempotency and
operation tracking as before. The side panel no longer lists every method a second time.

Selecting a branch also shows its own record in a compact **scope** section above the grid. This is
the same provider-owned data for every kind of branch: an RPC component can show its class,
capabilities and subscriber count; an interface namespace its version and implementation; another
tree may show folder or equipment metadata. The record is not turned into a leaf—the grid beneath
it still contains the leaves in that scope.

**Discovery costs nothing.** Every peer announces itself, so the console is handed everyone already online the moment it connects. There is no scan, no probe and no configured list of hosts. Over MQTT that is retained presence under `<prefix>/presence/+`; over socket.io the hub keeps the list.

With both, one list covers both networks and each peer is called over the link it was found on — which is the useful shape when a plant runs on a broker and the HMIs are browser pages. A peer hosted *in* a browser shows up like any other, since a page that dials a hub can serve as well as call.

**Descriptions stay honest.** The Network workspace describes announced peers with bounded
concurrency and caches what that taught, because it needs their component/resource catalogues to
draw the top-level scope. Presence carries a short hash of each peer's served description, so a peer
that restarts with a different surface, or exposes something new after it started, is noticed the
moment it announces. The console drops the stale catalogue entry and refreshes it; an unchanged peer
costs no extra describes.

A peer only appears in detail if its server was started with `exposeIntrospection`; otherwise the console says so rather than guessing.

**One port.** The page, `console.json` and the RPC link all arrive on 7844: socket.io answers `/socket.io` on the same listener the static app is served from. There is no second port to open and no CORS to configure, because the page and its server share an origin.

### Behind a reverse proxy

The console can be published under a path. Nothing needs configuring — the page works out where it was served from and hangs everything off that, so its assets, `console.json` and its socket all land back on the same mount:

```nginx
location /tools/console/ {
    proxy_pass http://console:7844/;      # the trailing slashes matter, on both lines
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```

Two things that will bite otherwise. **Both paths must end in `/`** — the page resolves everything relative to its mount point, and `/tools/console` without the slash resolves one level up, so the app asks `/tools/` for its files. And the `Upgrade` headers are what let socket.io leave long polling for a WebSocket; without them it still works, and quietly costs a round trip per frame.

That rule **strips** the prefix, which is what the trailing slash on `proxy_pass` does. For a proxy that forwards it through unchanged — `proxy_pass http://console:7844;`, no slash, or an ingress that does not rewrite — tell the console where it is published:

```
source-rpc console --hub http://bus:7843 --base-path /tools/console
source-rpc console on http://127.0.0.1:7844/tools/console/, watching http://bus:7843 as console-…
```

The page, its assets, `console.json` and socket.io then all answer under that path and nowhere else: a request to `/` gets a 404 rather than the app, because the rest of that origin belongs to whatever the proxy publishes beside it. `/tools/console` without the slash redirects to `/tools/console/`, since that is the only place the relative paths come out right.

Both ends of the same idea: the page always asks relative to where it was served, and `--base-path` tells the *server* to expect the prefix. Use it only when the proxy keeps the prefix — with a stripping rule it would put the console one level deeper than the proxy is looking.

### Calling a method

Choose **call** on a method row and the Actions panel opens a form with **one field per argument**,
built from the argument's own type rather than asking for the whole call as a JSON array:

| the schema says | you get |
| --- | --- |
| `number`, with `min`/`max` | a number input carrying those bounds |
| a union of literals | a dropdown of exactly those values |
| `boolean` | a checkbox |
| `date` | a date and time picker |
| `bytes` | a hex field |
| an object or a named type | a JSON box **pre-filled with the shape's required fields** |

Optional arguments have a checkbox that decides whether they are sent at all, so `writeSetpoint(1200)` and `writeSetpoint(1200, 'auto')` are both reachable. Argument names come from `paramNames` in the contract, which `extract` writes — without a contract the form falls back to positions, since nothing else knows what argument 0 is called.

JSON has no date and no byte string, so what is typed into a JSON box is walked against the type before it is sent: an ISO string where the schema says `date` becomes a `Date`. Otherwise every object with a timestamp in it would be rejected by the server that asked for one.

### State, and what it is drawn from

Press **observe** on a component and the panel fills with its props and state — not as a JSON blob, but drawn from the interfaces the contract publishes. `extract` reads a component's `Props` and `State` from the source, `describe()` carries them over, and the console has never seen the file: it knows `zones.top.setpoint` is a number and `door` is one of two words because the contract says so.

That is also why a field currently `null` is **labelled rather than omitted**. A panel drawn from the values alone cannot tell "this oven has no work order" from "this oven does not have work orders", and on a plant those are different facts.

The status sits beside the values and keeps its meaning: a dropped link marks the picture stale and **keeps it readable**, with the revision and "last known 14:03" next to it. Nothing blanks.

### Two panes: scope on the left, values on the right

One tree of everything is right for an oven and wrong for anything carrying hundreds of values, which plants have. So the panel is two panes.

The left first chooses a **resource**. `props` and `state` are ordinary built-in DataProvider resources beside tables, queues and any others the component declares. Choosing a tree-shaped resource opens the same scope tree used everywhere else; selecting a branch asks that provider for everything beneath it — *recursively, all the way down* — so the tree scopes the grid rather than becoming a second value display.

The right holds **values**, flat, one row each.

The provider decides what is scope and what is a leaf. For the built-in component provider, ordinary nested objects are branches, arrays and scalars are leaves, and a process reading carrying `value` with `quality`, `unit`, `forced` or `at` remains one leaf. A store-backed provider can make a different truthful choice: an OPC UA Variable may have children and still be a leaf, while an empty folder is scope despite having no children. `grouping` and `hasChildren` state those two facts separately.

Only the resource catalogue is known before a value arrives. Branches are loaded lazily through `getChildren`, so a record with thousands of keys does not become thousands of tree nodes until somebody opens that branch.

Every grid is fed through [`$data`](../guide/components.md#asking-for-a-page-instead-of-watching-one). For `props` and `state`, the base component is the provider: `getChildren` answers one branch and recursive `getList` answers the paged leaves beneath the selected scope. A table or queue answers the same verbs from its own store. The component observation remains open for live revision/freshness and source bindings; it is no longer a second rendering path.

### The observer on a page of its own

Beside **observe** is a **full page ↗** link, and it is an ordinary link: middle-click opens it beside the console, ctrl-click puts it in a new tab, right-click copies an address that can go in a runbook or onto a wall display.

What it opens is the same observer with the console taken away — no peer list, no traffic column, no tabs — so the scope tree and the value grid get the whole window instead of the middle third of it. The two panes scroll independently, which is what makes the form worth having: a deep tree on the left and a long list on the right, neither pushing the other off the screen.

The address is `?observe=<peer>&ns=<namespace>` under wherever the console is served, so it survives a base path and can be written by hand. A page opened this way **starts observing on its own**, because a display that is wrong until somebody walks over and presses a button is a display nobody should trust.

### Filtering happens on the peer

One box serves the pane, and its condition goes to the provider, so a search matching nothing costs a sentence on the wire rather than a record.

A bare word matches the row id, `field:word` narrows to a field of the row, `&` is and and `|` is or — so `setp` finds `zones.top.setpoint` inside the `state` resource, and `quality:bad` is answerable at all, which it is not from the browser at any bandwidth: finding out which thirty of three hundred are bad is exactly what a local filter would have to receive all three hundred to discover.

Both ends call the library's own matcher rather than each keeping a version of it. A search that meant two different things either side of one pane would be worse than no search at all, and that is the sort of difference nobody notices until it has been trusted.

What the box compiles to is **data, never a program**: `{ field: 'quality', op: 'contains', operand: 'bad' }`, which the peer checks and can refuse. The console this grammar came from ended the same function with `new RegExp`, which is safe in a browser against an in-memory store and is a stall on a plant server that re-evaluates it on every request.

Typing settles before it asks, so eight keystrokes are one question. The count beside the pager is the number of *matches*, and the three ways a page can be empty stay distinguishable: `empty`, `nothing matches`, and `past the end` for a set that shrank while it was being read.

### Filtering across the network

The same grid filter works at every scope. At Network or peer scope, structural conditions such as
`peer`, `namespace`, `resource` and `interface` first prune providers; remaining row conditions are
sent to those providers. Results keep complete peer, component, resource and row identity, so a row
can be previewed through the provider that owns it rather than copied into a search-only view.

Filtering is case-insensitive, settles for 400 ms before fanning out, and stays bounded. The answer
names sources that refused or could not answer while keeping successful rows usable. The current
aggregate is deliberately a bounded first page; exact pagination across independently changing
providers requires a distributed continuation cursor rather than a fake global offset.

### When nothing is happening, it says so

A pane that reads `asking…` and nothing else is indistinguishable from one that has died, and that is most of the time anybody spends wondering what is wrong. So it shows two numbers instead of one.

**How long it has been waiting**, ticking, while a fetch is in flight. **How long the peer says it spent**, once the answer lands and only when that is long enough to matter. Their difference is the link — and without the second, a slow query and a dead link look identical from a browser.

The peer reports the other half itself. A `slowRequest` event fires on the server when a `$data` request takes long enough to have held it up, naming the resource, the time and whether the component or the library answered. That belongs there rather than here, because the library-served path filters and sorts **synchronously**: a large enough collection holds the event loop, and everything that peer does stops — snapshots included. From outside, a peer stalled on its own query and a peer that has gone are the same silence.

An error names the resource it was asking about, rather than only what went wrong.

### How often it asks

A subscription's rate belongs to the component — its commit rate and its publish bound. On a slow link that is backwards, so the pages are polled at a period the person watching sets: 1s, 5s, 30s, or manual with a refresh.

`manual` is a real setting rather than a degenerate one. A row of value, unit and quality is about 50 bytes, so a 50-row page is roughly 20 kbit — seventeen seconds at 1200 bits/s, where a five-second period is not slow but arithmetically impossible. On a LAN one second is free. Same grid, one dial.

Four details make the period behave rather than pile up: the next fetch is scheduled when the previous one **settles**, never on a fixed interval, so a five-second timer against a thirty-second round trip cannot end up with six requests in flight; nothing is asked while the tab is hidden, and returning to it asks at once; the last answer stays on screen while a fetch is in flight, marked *refreshing*, because last-known with its age on it is an answer and a blank is not; and a page refetches immediately when a call settles, since waiting out a period to learn whether the plant accepted `setSetpoint(180)` is the one place a period is plainly wrong.

**Every leaf subscribes to its own path.** A component carrying 300 tags, one of which moves five times a second, would otherwise re-render 300 rows to move one number — so each leaf reads its own value through `useSyncExternalStore`, and a primitive that did not change bails out before React does any work. Branches subscribe to as little as they need to know their shape; the panel header reads only the status and whether data has arrived. Observing a 300-tag component for fifteen seconds, measured in headless Chrome:

| | script | layout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| re-render the tree from the snapshot | 312 ms | 34 ms |
| each leaf subscribes to its own value | 39 ms | 35 ms |

Layout is unchanged, which is the point worth keeping: React's diffing already kept the *DOM* work to the row that moved. What the arrangement saves is the render pass — the JS spent deciding that 299 rows still say what they said.

### Changing a value is calling a method

A state row is never written. Where the contract offers a way to change a field, the row **proposes a call** and shows it in full — `setSetpoint(180)` — and what the operator commits is that call, not a value.

**Which method is read from the contract, never guessed from a name.** A row gets an editor when some method declares [`@rpc({ sets: 'setpoint' })`](../guide/components.md#saying-what-a-method-sets) for that path, and gets none otherwise. A peer that declares nothing offers no editors at all, which is the honest answer rather than a guess.

The panel used to look for a one-argument `set<Field>`, which is right almost always — the residue being methods like `setMode`, which may begin a transition with an interlock behind it rather than assign `state.mode`, or `setPressure` sitting beside a measured `state.pressure`. A guess that is wrong is wrong *silently*, in the direction of commanding a plant, and nothing on the row shows it. Reading the declaration instead also reaches where a naming rule never could: `zones.top.setpoint` gets an editor two levels down, and the `zones.top.temperature` beside it — same shape, same type — correctly gets none.

A component carrying a few hundred tags declares one [generic setter](../guide/components.md#the-generic-setter-and-its-gate) instead of a marker per field, and then every leaf gets an editor — the path travels as an argument. That is coarser on purpose: the contract cannot say which of those paths the method will actually accept, so some attempts are refused by the component and the refusal arrives where the value would have been. A host that did not opt in publishes no such claim at all, and the panel offers nothing.

Nothing is written locally on success. The number on screen moves when the plant publishes its next snapshot, which is the only report that the plant agrees — an optimistic row would show a setpoint the oven refused. A refusal arrives where the value would have been.

### Every press carries an idempotency key

The CLI attached one and the console did not, which was the wrong way round: the CLI is driven by somebody typing a command they can read back, and the console is the thing an operator actually presses. Without a key, a second press after `UnknownOutcome` is a second command — and on a plant that is the difference between one pump start and two.

**A key per press, held for the retry, and gone the moment anything else is committed.** A key generated per *attempt* would buy nothing, since that is what the request id already is; one derived from the value would be worse, because committing 180, then 190, then 180 again is three decisions and the third would be answered with the first one's result.

So the offer to try again appears **only where nobody knows what happened**, and it uses the library's own `mayHaveRun` rather than a second opinion — a screen disagreeing with the tray beside it about whether a command may have run would be disagreeing in front of an operator about the only question that mattered. An ordinary refusal gets no such button: the interlock being open is a fact, and pressing it again gets the same fact.

It applies to all three ways the console commands a plant: an editor drawn from `sets`, an action offered on a row, and the method panel's **Call**. The last of those is relayed — the call to the plant is made by the console process rather than by the browser — so the key travels as an argument of the console's own `call` verb to reach the wire at all. The **repeat** button deliberately carries no key and offers no retry: it says twenty calls and means twenty, which for a command is twenty commands, and there is no single intent for a second attempt to be at.

### The operations tray

Every other tab in the right-hand column is about the **network**: what it carried, what it refused, who came and went. `operations` is about **this page** — what it asked other peers to do, and how each of those turned out — and it exists for one row: the command that was sent and never answered.

The count on the tab is not a count of things to read. It is a count of commands nobody knows the outcome of, so it stays until each is dealt with rather than clearing when the tab is opened. Three views: `uncertain` (the default), `commands` — which is `semantics !== 'query'`, so it keeps the undeclared ones, because a method that says nothing about what it does must be treated as a command — and `everything`.

Each row carries the peer and method, how long it took, the idempotency key the press was made under, and, where the outcome is unknown, a `dismiss` that has to be pressed on purpose. `clear settled` takes only what is over and certain: an uncertain outcome is the one row nobody may remove with a button that says something else.

**A relayed command is recorded as the command it is about**, not as the relay. The method panel's calls are made by the console process, and the console reports the plant's answer as a *value* rather than by failing — so this page's own entry for `console.call` says *succeeded*, correctly, while the command may have been left in the air. The row says `oven3 · plant.writeSetpoint via console-…`, which keeps the two facts apart: the relay not answering says nothing about the plant, and the relay answering *with* an uncertain outcome says the command reached the plant and nobody knows what it did.

It is this page's own registry and nothing wider — `client.operations`, which the library writes at `callWith`. A command another operator sent from another page is not in it.

### Context

Each node's panel can also show what it **inherits**: the site it stands in, the work order it is running, the maintenance window that applies to it. Type a token id — `acme.site` — pick the axis, and the console watches it; what it watches is remembered per peer.

The answer comes from the node's own host, over [`contextAt()`](../guide/context.md#asking-about-another-peers-node). The console does not resolve chains itself and does not graft itself into the topology next to whatever it wants to read, which would be a claim about the plant that is false. A `collect` token shows the whole chain, nearest first, each entry naming where it was provided.

**There is no list of tokens to pick from, and that is deliberate.** Context has no enumeration surface: listing what ambient data a plant carries is reconnaissance, and a token whose provider declares `exposure: 'local'` is filtered from remote answers silently rather than refused — a refusal would confirm it exists. So an operator types the ids they are entitled to know.

The axis is picked rather than guessed for the same reason it is elsewhere: it belongs to the token's definition, the console has not seen that definition, and there is no fallback between the two.

### The console describes itself

Both services this package runs — the CLI's `console` namespace and the `chat` namespace the page hosts — ship a contract extracted from their own source, so pointing one console at another gives argument fields rather than `call(…)` and `say(…)`:

```
npm run contract        # extract both, into src/console.types.json and web/src/chat.types.json
npm run check:contract  # the same comparison the server applies to an older caller
```

The files are committed, which makes them reviewable and lets `check:contract` fail a build that would refuse a peer built against the old one. A test asserts they still match their source, since a service changed without re-extracting would ship a contract describing the old shape.

The console's own contract was the first thing to need `record`: `describe()` returns a `ServerDescription`, built out of `{ [name: string]: TypeNode }` — so until the type language could describe a dictionary, it could not describe its own output.

The chat contract is the one that has to survive a bundler. `@rpc` and `@rpcNamespace` are standard ECMAScript decorators, and they come through Vite's build intact — which is also what keeps the namespace called `chat` rather than the minified class name, and what `extract` reads statically to write the contract in the first place.

### Watching events

**Watch all** takes every event in a namespace in one click, which is the usual first move on an unfamiliar peer. The events pane has a filter, a pause and an **export** that saves what is on screen as jsonl — the same shape `source-rpc record` writes and `jq` reads. Pausing stops the buffer filling rather than only the list rendering, so a paused pane on a busy network stays as it was.

Arguments worth keeping get a **save** button. Presets are stored in the browser and keyed by namespace and method rather than by peer, so a set saved against one cell is offered on the next — the reason to save a setpoint sequence usually being that five more cabinets are coming. They are named by what they hold, so there is nothing to type.

Each method keeps its timings: **×20** calls it repeatedly and reports `20 calls · p50 1 ms · last 1 ms` next to the button, which is `source-rpc bench` in miniature for when the question is smaller than a benchmark. **copy as CLI** puts the equivalent `source-rpc call …` on the clipboard, complete with the network flags this console was started with — a call worth making in a browser is usually one worth putting in a script, and retyping `--hub http://…` from memory is where that stops happening.

The watch button toggles, and unwatching drops the server's subscription too rather than only silencing the browser — the subscriber count next to the event moves with it. Closing the console unsubscribes everything it held, so a debugging session does not leave listeners behind on servers that outlive it.

### How it is built

The browser half is a React app talking to the CLI **over msgrpc itself**. The CLI runs an `RpcServer` on the same HTTP server that serves the page and exposes a `console` namespace (`peers`, `describe`, `call`, `watch`, `unwatch`) plus `event` and `peer` events. There is no REST API and no server-sent events, and the console is the library's own first client — a bug in event routing shows up here before it reaches a plant.

The page closes its connection on `pagehide` rather than only on unmount, because React's cleanup does not run when a document is torn down by a navigation - a page that did not would stay a peer in everyone's list until the console reaped it, and socket.io's long-polling transport means a handful of those exhausts the browser's per-host connection limit and stops the next page connecting at all. If a handshake does fail, the page tries again three times before saying so.

Each page takes a random readable name — `page-drink-love-spy` — kept in `sessionStorage`, so a reload comes back as the same peer and a second tab is simply a different one. It is not derived from the URL, because a name is an address: every browser pointed at one console would derive the same one, and then two pages answer to it and each other's replies go to whichever the console registered last. A page cannot detect that, since `localStorage` is per browser profile and cannot see the other browser. Add `?name=lab-browser` to give a page a name of its own — the page's version of the CLI's `--name` — for when it should be recognisable in a peer list rather than merely unique.

The page is an `RpcServer` too, not a client. It serves over the connection it opens to the console, which is the only thing a browser can do since it cannot listen, and that is what lets its `chat` namespace be called by another peer. The same object calls outwards with `proxy()`, so browsing the network and hosting a service on it share one link and one name. Chat exists to exercise exactly that direction: two consoles on one bus, a page on each, and a message crossing between them tests dial-out serving, presence propagation and relaying in a way no amount of calling the console can.

Everything is bundled into the CLI's `dist`: no CDN, no runtime download. A plant network usually has no route to the internet, and a page that fetches from one renders blank exactly where it is needed.

`npm run dev:web` in the package serves the app with hot reload against a console started separately on port 7844.

### Signed networks

A server configured with `verify` drops unsigned frames before the RPC layer. Without keys the console still lists peers — presence is unsigned retained state — and then every call times out with nothing to say why. Give it keys with `--sign`:

```
source-rpc console --broker mqtt://broker:1883 --sign console-keys.json
```

```json
{
  "name": "console-1",
  "secret": "the console's own HMAC secret",
  "peers": { "plantServer": "that server's secret" }
}
```

A file rather than a flag, because a secret on the command line is visible to anyone who can run `ps`. The console warns if the file is readable by other users.

`peers` is optional. Supplying it makes the console check signatures on what it receives as well, which means frames from an unsigned peer are then dropped.

The server checks a signature against the key it holds for the name the frame claims, so the console's name has to be the one its key belongs to. `name` in the file supplies it; passing a `--name` that contradicts the file is refused rather than left to surface as a timeout.

HMAC only. For Ed25519 or an HSM, build the console with the library's `startConsole` and pass your own `MessageSigner`.

### Other limits

**It binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.** The console can invoke any method it is allowed to, so exposing it has to be a deliberate act: `--host 0.0.0.0` works and prints a warning saying what you have just done.

**Credentials are thin.** Broker credentials work if they fit in the url (`mqtt://user:pass@host`); TLS client certificates have nowhere to go yet, and neither does a private certificate authority — `--insecure-tls` accepts any certificate at all, which is a development answer and not a plant one. A hub that authenticates needs a handshake token, which has no flag for the same reason the signing keys do not — build the console from the library's `startConsole` and pass `hubCredentials`.

**`--prefix` is MQTT's.** A socket.io hub has no topic namespace, so the flag does nothing for `--hub`. Watching two MQTT networks at once is not possible either; it is one broker and one hub.

**Give it its own name on a busy network.** The default is unique per process, but a peer name maps to an MQTT client id and a broker allows one connection per id, so two consoles sharing a `--name` will disconnect each other.

## Presence

A peer that flaps is one of the commonest faults on a plant and the hardest to catch in the act. The console used to show it as a dot that changed colour and then forgot, so a device dropping every thirty seconds looked exactly like one that was simply up.

```
flakyCell has arrived 4 times

3:36:43 AM  −  flakyCell   http://localhost:8090
3:36:41 AM  +  flakyCell   http://localhost:8090
3:36:38 AM  +  polish-2
3:36:38 AM  −  flakyCell   http://localhost:8090
```

Kept by the console and handed over when a page connects, so **opening the console after the trouble still shows it** — and anything that has arrived three times or more in the window is called out by name, because that is the fault and the rest is a Tuesday.

Each peer in the list also says **what it is** — broker, console, page, device, or served without a contract. That is learned from descriptions the console was already making when you select a peer or when it goes looking for a bus to tap, so the labels fill in as the network is used and an idle console costs exactly what it did before.

## Problems

The **Problems** tab is where a call that never comes back says why. Four things the transports have always reported and nothing used to listen to:

| kind | what it means |
| --- | --- |
| `rejected` | the frame was refused before it reached the RPC layer — a bad signature, an unsafe name, something undecodable |
| `unroutable` | there was nowhere to deliver it: no such peer, a relay refused, or too many hops |
| `peerDisplaced` | two peers are answering to one name, so replies reach whichever connected last |
| `transportError` | the link itself failed |

```
1:26:44 AM  peerDisplaced  on this console
            twin-hmi
            another connection claimed this name
1:26:42 AM  unroutable     on this console
            lost-caller → no-such-device
            no route to the target
```

There is nothing to switch on: these cost nothing when nothing is wrong, and the ones worth reading are usually from before anyone thought to look. The console keeps a bounded history and hands it over when a page connects, so **opening the console after the trouble still shows it** — which is the usual way round.

`source-rpc watch <console> console.problem` streams the same thing to a shell, and `source-rpc call <console> console.problems` fetches the history.

Each peer in the list also now carries **the link it was found on**, which on a plant with the devices on a broker and the HMIs on a hub is the first thing worth knowing about one.

## The traffic tap

A console sees its own calls and the events it subscribed to, which on a real network is a small fraction of what is happening. The broker sees everything, because it is the thing forwarding it. `bus` is the one namespace it exposes, and it is **turned on by a call rather than a flag** — a plant bus that has to be restarted before it can be watched will not be watched, since the run worth looking at is the one already going wrong.

```
$ source-rpc call plantBus bus.tap '{"peer":"plantServer","payloads":true}' --hub http://bus:7843
{ "token": "tap-1", "expires": 1785272777436, "filter": { … } }

$ source-rpc watch plantBus bus.frame --hub http://bus:7843
→  hmi-3 -> plantServer  plant.writeSetpoint[1200,"auto"]
⇒  plantServer -> hmi-3  plant.alarm["setpoint moved",1]
←  plantServer -> hmi-3  plant.writeSetpoint  2ms
→  hmi-3 -> plantServer  plant.read[]
←  plantServer -> hmi-3  plant.read  1ms
→  hmi-3 -> plantServer  plant.fault[]
←  plantServer -> hmi-3  plant.fault  0ms  Exception: valve jammed
```

(The arrows are `jq` over the jsonl; `watch` writes one JSON object per line.)

| method | |
| --- | --- |
| `tap(filter?)` | start watching; returns a token |
| `untap(token)` | stop watching that one |
| `taps()` | who is watching what, and how much each has seen |

Frames arrive as the `frame` event, so anything that can subscribe to an msgrpc event can read them — the console, `source-rpc watch`, or a program of your own.

**It knows what a frame is**, which is what a topic browser pointed at the same wire cannot do. A call and its reply share a correlation id, so the reply is reported with the method it answers and the time it took — neither of which is in the reply itself.

| filter | |
| --- | --- |
| `peer` | only frames this peer sent or received — "mirror that device" |
| `namespace` | only this namespace; applies to replies too, since a reply is paired with its call first |
| `kinds` | any of `POST`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, `EVENT` |
| `payloads` | include arguments, results and event payloads. **Off by default** |
| `ttl` | seconds before the tap drops itself. Default 300, maximum 3600 |

Payloads are off by default because the metadata is what a debugging session usually needs, and a plant bus carries values nobody meant to hand to whoever happened to be tapping. Several taps can run at once with different filters; each frame names the taps it matched, and payloads are carried only if one of them asked.

Taps expire on their own, because a console that closes without untapping would otherwise leave the broker building and emitting frames for a subscriber that is not there.

Traffic addressed *to* the broker is not tapped — only what it relays — so turning the tap on and reading it back does not feed itself.

### On MQTT, the console does the watching

There is no broker of ours on an MQTT network to hook, so the observation happens at the subscription instead: `<prefix>/rpc/+` under the 3.1.1 layout, each of `<prefix>/{req,rsp,evt}/+` under MQTT 5. A console started with `--broker` exposes the same `bus` namespace and watches for itself.

**The tap gets its own broker connection**, opened when the first tap starts and closed after the last one ends. A peer subscribed to both its own topic and the wildcard covering it has overlapping subscriptions, and a broker is permitted to deliver a matching message once per subscription — which for a request means the method runs twice. A separate connection is a separate client id and a separate session, so the two can never overlap. It also means an idle console costs a plant broker nothing.

Frames are reported without checking signatures: a tap holds no key for a conversation it is not part of, and what is on the wire is what it exists to show.

Either way the answer arrives the same: ask the console, and it turns on whatever it can reach.

```
$ source-rpc call myConsole console.tap '{"peer":"plantServer"}' --broker mqtt://localhost:1883
{ "token": "console-tap-1", "sources": ["this console"] }
$ source-rpc watch myConsole console.frame --broker mqtt://localhost:1883
```

`sources` says who is doing the watching — a broker's `bus` on socket.io, `this console` on MQTT, or both when it holds both links.

### In the console

The left menu has a **Traffic** workspace. It is off until you press **tap**, and the setup above it decides what to ask for: arguments and results, only the selected peer, and which kinds. Once running it shows the source it found, a filter box, **pause**, and one row per frame — colour-coded by kind, with the reply carrying the method it answers and the time it took.

The workspace stays tapping while you look elsewhere; the count in the left menu is what has arrived.
