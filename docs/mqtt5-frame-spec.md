<!-- The wire identifiers in this document are deliberately unchanged by the 3.0 rename: the packages and the command became Source RPC, the protocol stayed msgrpc. A peer deployed against v1 or v2 keeps working, which is the whole point of writing the format down.

  What did change in 3.0 is the signed frame version, `mr-v`, which went 1 -> 2. Version 2 covers the content type, the error code, the declared contract version, the response topic and the ttl in the signature; version 1 covered none of them, and a frame signed under version 1 no longer verifies. That gate applies only to signed frames - an unsigned plain-MQTT peer sending `mr-v: 1` is still accepted, because its version says nothing about security and interop is the point. See the Security section of the changelog.

  Version 3 adds `mr-fence` and covers it in the signature. The gate rule is unchanged and applies for a sharper reason: version 2 signed everything except the fence, so honouring a version 2 signature on a version 3 network would let a sender choose the form in which deleting one property disarms the check entirely. -->

# msgrpc over MQTT 5 — frame layout

**Status: implemented.** `MqttTransport` speaks this by default (`protocol: 5`); `protocol: 4` keeps the older `$`-delimited header for brokers that need it. Verified against a live broker with vanilla mqtt.js on the far side, in `src/Mqtt5.test.ts`.

Shared subscriptions (`sharedGroup` / `replicaId`) and bounded sessions (`sessionExpirySeconds`) are implemented too.

## Why

Today an outsider wanting to call `plant.writeSetpoint(1200)` must publish, on `msgrpc/v1/rpc/plantServer`:

```
{"source":"hmi","target":"plantServer","time":1785187832623,"seq":0}$<msgpack>
```

with the msgpack decoding to a doubly-nested envelope, and must know that `type: 'POST'` means "call", that `path` is the instance name, and that replies correlate by `payload.id` on `msgrpc/v1/rpc/hmi`. None of that is discoverable, and in MQTT tooling it renders as an opaque blob.

MQTT 5 has request/response in the protocol: **Response Topic** says where to reply, **Correlation Data** matches reply to request. Moving to it makes a frame self-describing in any MQTT 5 client and in standard tooling, and unlocks two things that matter more than interop for control systems: message expiry and shared subscriptions.

## Topics

| topic | carries | subscribed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<prefix>/req/<peer>` | calls and subscribe/unsubscribe requests | peers that serve |
| `<prefix>/rsp/<peer>` | results and errors | peers that call |
| `<prefix>/evt/<peer>` | events pushed to a subscriber | peers that subscribe to events |
| `<prefix>/presence/<peer>` | retained `online` / `offline` (unchanged) | all |

Requests are on their own topic because **shared subscriptions only make sense there**. Replicas of a server subscribe `$share/<group>/<prefix>/req/plantServer` and the broker distributes requests among them. If responses shared that topic they would be load-balanced too, and a reply meant for one requester would land on a replica instead.

Splitting `rsp` from `evt` costs one subscription and buys least-privilege ACLs: a pure client never subscribes to `req`, a pure server never subscribes to `evt`.

The default prefix moves `msgrpc/v1` → `msgrpc/v2`. v1 and v2 peers therefore share a broker without seeing each other, and a bridge peer can run one transport of each during migration.

## Encoding

MsgPack by default, JSON accepted. MsgPack sits between JSON and protobuf on size and parse cost without a schema toolchain, and has small allocation-light C implementations for constrained targets — which matters when the fleet includes embedded devices sending a lot of data.

- `contentType` states which is in use: `application/msgpack` or `application/json`.
- `payloadFormatIndicator` is `0` for msgpack, `1` for JSON, so tooling renders payloads correctly.
- **A responder replies in the request's `contentType`.** A JSON-speaking third party gets JSON back without negotiating anything, and source-rpc peers stay on msgpack throughout.

## User properties

All msgrpc control fields are prefixed `mr-`, so a broker or gateway that injects its own user properties (`clientid`, `username`, `peerhost` and similar) cannot be mistaken for one of ours. The prefix is kept to three characters because every key is carried in full on every packet, and packet overhead is a real cost on constrained links.

MQTT permits a user property to repeat. **A frame with any `mr-*` property present more than once is rejected**, rather than taking the first or last — a duplicated control field is an ambiguity worth refusing, not resolving.

| property | on | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mr-v` | all | frame format version, currently `3` |
| `mr-src` | all | sending peer name |
| `mr-kind` | all | `call` \| `subscribe` \| `unsubscribe` \| `result` \| `error` \| `event` |
| `mr-path` | call, subscribe, event | exposed instance name |
| `mr-method` | call, subscribe | method name |
| `mr-event` | event | event name |
| `mr-code` | error | `RpcErrorCode` |
| `mr-ver` | call, subscribe | contract version the caller declares |
| `mr-ttl` | call, subscribe | milliseconds the caller will still wait, counted from sending |
| `mr-idem` | call | names the command this is an attempt at, when the caller distinguishes the two |
| `mr-fence` | call | the owner generation the caller observed for `mr-path`, when it fences |
| `mr-nonce`, `mr-ts`, `mr-sig` | signed frames | replay and signature fields |

### Why `mr-fence` had to exist

A fence is checked by being present. A responder that finds no fence on a call does not fall back to a weaker check — it applies none, and runs the command under whatever ownership holds the instance now. So a layout with no representation for a fence does not degrade the guarantee, it removes it, and silently: the caller sees an ordinary successful call and has no way to learn its fence never travelled.

That is what this layout did until frame version 3. `mr-fence` did not exist, `toOutboundFrame` dropped the payload's `fence`, and every fenced call over MQTT 5 arrived unfenced — including the queued and redelivered ones a fence exists for in the first place. The socket.io path carried it throughout, so the feature's own tests went on passing while the transport a plant actually runs on ignored it.

### Why `mr-ttl` as well as `messageExpiryInterval`

They answer different questions. Expiry is the broker's: whole seconds, decremented while queued, and it stops at the moment of delivery. `mr-ttl` is the caller's own statement of how long it will wait, it is signed, and it survives being relayed onto a transport that is not MQTT at all.

A responder uses both. Expiry, which the broker rewrites, may only **narrow** the ttl and never extend it, so what is left when the two are combined is the caller's signed budget minus the time the broker actually held the message — measured by the broker, with nobody's clock compared to anybody else's.

A duration rather than a deadline is deliberate: an absolute time is only as good as the agreement between two clocks, and one of the peers on this network is a browser page whose clock belongs to whoever is sitting at it. A wrong clock would refuse every command that page sent, which is worse than the late execution this exists to prevent.

## Request

```
topic                    msgrpc/v2/req/plantServer
responseTopic            msgrpc/v2/rsp/hmi
correlationData          <16 random bytes>
contentType              application/msgpack
payloadFormatIndicator   0
messageExpiryInterval    10                       # seconds, from mr-ttl rounded up
userProperties
  mr-v                   3
  mr-src                 hmi
  mr-kind                call
  mr-path                plant
  mr-method              writeSetpoint
  mr-ttl                 10000                    # ms the caller will still wait
  mr-fence               e-7f21c9                 # only when the caller fences on owner generation
  mr-nonce               <base64>                 # signed frames only
  mr-ts                  1785187832623            # signed frames only
  mr-sig                 <base64>                 # signed frames only
payload                  <msgpack of [1200]>      # the argument array, nothing else
```

`correlationData` replaces the `id` field. `mr-src` is retained even though `responseTopic` implies it, because identity has to be bound explicitly by the signature rather than inferred from a topic.

**The Response Topic is where the answer goes.** Not a topic derived from `mr-src` — a caller that subscribes somewhere of its own choosing is answered there, which is what MQTT 5 request/response means and what an outside implementer would expect. Two rules bound it, because the caller is choosing a topic somebody else will publish to:

- it must be a publishable topic: no wildcards, no control characters, and not under `$`;
- it must sit under the transport's prefix, which is the boundary broker ACLs are usually drawn on. `allowResponseTopic` replaces that rule where an installation needs something else.

A request naming a topic outside the rule is **refused**, not quietly answered on a derived topic: a caller waiting on the topic it named is not helped by a reply sent elsewhere.

For `mr-kind: subscribe` the payload is the argument array holding the event name, e.g. `["alarm"]`, so every request has one shape.

## Response

```
topic                    msgrpc/v2/rsp/hmi        # whatever responseTopic said
correlationData          <echoed verbatim>
contentType              application/msgpack      # mirrors the request
userProperties
  mr-v                   3
  mr-src                 plantServer
  mr-kind                result
  mr-nonce, mr-ts, mr-sig                         # signed frames only
payload                  <msgpack of 1200>        # the return value, encoded bare
```

Errors keep the shape with `mr-kind: error`, an `mr-code` carrying the `RpcErrorCode`, and a payload of `{name, message, stack?}`:

```
userProperties   mr-v=3  mr-src=plantServer  mr-kind=error  mr-code=Forbidden
payload          <msgpack of {"name":"RpcError","message":"not permitted to call plant.writeSetpoint"}>
```

Putting the code in a property means an operator can see *why* a call failed in MQTT Explorer without decoding the payload.

## Event

```
topic            msgrpc/v2/evt/hmi
                 # no correlationData: unsolicited
userProperties
  mr-v           3
  mr-src         plantServer
  mr-kind        event
  mr-path        plant
  mr-event       alarm
  mr-nonce, mr-ts, mr-sig                         # signed frames only
payload          <msgpack of ["high pressure"]>   # the emit argument array
```

## Signing

The signature must cover everything that decides what a frame means and where it goes. Since the topic now carries the addressing, it is signed rather than a `target` field:

```
signedInput = utf8(JSON.stringify([
    v, topic, responseTopic, src, kind, path, methodOrEvent, correlation,
    contentType, code, contractVersion, ttl, idempotencyKey, fence, ts, nonce
])) || payload
```

Fields are signed **positionally by value**, so the `mr-` property naming does not enter the canonical form and renaming a property later would not silently change what verifies. Absent fields are `""`; `correlation` is `""` for events. A JSON array fixes order and escapes values, so no combination of names can be made to look like a different frame. `v` is included so a later format revision cannot be made to verify under these rules.

**Everything the receiver acts on is covered.** Version 1 left out `contentType`, on the reasoning that it only says how to read bytes that are themselves signed — so altering it could make a payload fail to parse but never change what was authorised. That reasoning is wrong, and the counterexample is one byte long: `0x31` is the JSON text `"1"`, which is the number 1, and a MsgPack positive fixint, which is 49. Both parse. Both verified. Flipping one unsigned property turned a signed `writeSetpoint(1)` into a signed `writeSetpoint(49)`.

The same argument covers the rest of what version 2 added: `code` decides what a caller does about a failure, `contractVersion` decides whether the call is accepted at all, `responseTopic` decides where the answer is published, `ttl` decides whether a command that is already too late still runs, and `mr-idem` decides whether a command that has already run runs again.

Version 3 adds `fence`, and it is the sharpest case of the rule rather than an exception to it. Every other signed field can be *changed* to change the meaning of a frame; `mr-fence` only has to be **removed**. An unsigned fence would mean anyone on the path could turn a command that was meant to be refused under a new ownership into one that executes, by deleting a property — no key, no forgery, and nothing at either end to notice.

`messageExpiryInterval` is deliberately **not** signed, because the broker is required to decrement it in flight and a signature over it would break on the first queued message. Nothing is lost: it may only narrow the signed `mr-ttl`, so rewriting it can delay or drop a frame — which anyone able to rewrite it could do anyway — but cannot buy a stale command more time.

Replay protection is unchanged: `mr-nonce` plus the `mr-ts` freshness window, with `messageExpiryInterval` as defence in depth at the broker.

## Session and delivery

| | MQTT 3.1.1 (today) | MQTT 5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| server session | `clean: false`, never expires | `cleanStart: false` + `sessionExpiryInterval` |
| client session | `clean: true`, no queueing | `cleanStart: false` + short expiry, so queueing without permanent broker litter |
| stale requests | delivered late, executed | dropped by the broker at `messageExpiryInterval` |
| server HA | not possible | shared subscription on `req` |

`messageExpiryInterval` closes a real hole: a request queued for a persistent server session can arrive long after the caller timed out, and the server executes it. It is not a duplicate, so duplicate suppression does not help.

The expiry is taken from `mr-ttl`, which is the caller's own timeout. The two used to be set independently — a ten-second call timeout against a thirty-second expiry — so a request could be delivered and executed twenty seconds after the operator had already been told the call failed. For a read that is wasted work; for `start pump` or `reset fault` it is a machine moving when nobody expects it to.

A responder that is handed a request should therefore check the budget **immediately before running the method**, not only on arrival. The broker's expiry covers the queue in front of the broker; it says nothing about a request that arrived promptly and then waited on something slow inside the process serving it.

## What a third party has to implement

A responder serving one namespace:

1. Subscribe `<prefix>/req/<name>`.
2. On a message, read `mr-path` and `mr-method` and decode the payload as an argument array using `contentType`.
3. If `mr-ttl` is present, stop and answer `mr-code=Timeout` when more than that many milliseconds have passed since the message arrived — less whatever the broker already deducted from `messageExpiryInterval`. Check it just before running the method, not on arrival. If `mr-idem` is present and the method is one a repeat would change something with, look the key up before running and answer from the recorded outcome if it is there. If `mr-fence` is present and you keep a record of who owns `mr-path`, compare the two and answer `mr-code=OwnershipChanged` on any difference — including when you hold no record at all, which fails closed rather than running a command whose fence you cannot check.
4. Publish the result to the packet's `responseTopic`, echoing `correlationData`, with `mr-kind=result` and the same `contentType`.

No msgrpc framing, no `$` splitting, no nested envelope. A caller is the mirror image. A third party that prefers JSON simply sets `contentType: application/json` and gets JSON replies.

## Known limits

- **Shared subscriptions suit stateless calls, not event subscriptions.** A client subscribing to events registers with whichever replica received the request, and only that replica will emit to it. Event fan-out across replicas needs shared state, and is out of scope here.
- **A resumed session delivers its queue the instant it connects.** Instances therefore have to be exposed before `ready()` is awaited; anything registered afterwards is too late for the requests that were queued while the server was down, and those callers get `ClassNotFound`.
- **Replicas do not announce presence.** One replica's will would declare the whole shared name offline while its siblings were still serving, so they observe presence without publishing it.
- **Duplicate suppression stays per-replica.** A QoS 1 redelivery that lands on a different replica after one dies would not be recognised as a repeat. Exactly-once across replicas needs a shared store.
- **Interop and signing pull against each other.** Full third-party participation on a signed topic means publishing this canonicalisation so outsiders can implement it. Cheaper to reserve signing for links crossing a trust boundary and rely on broker ACLs elsewhere.
- **Requires an MQTT 5 broker.** EMQX 5 and Mosquitto 2.x are fine; some embedded brokers are 3.1.1 only.

## Implementation shape

The RPC handlers currently build a `Message` object that is msgpack-encoded and then framed with a `$` header, so a transport only ever sees opaque bytes. MQTT 5 needs structured access to kind, path, method, correlation and arguments.

That means introducing a transport-independent `RpcFrame` — `{kind, src, target, path, method, event, correlation, args | result | error}` — that handlers emit and each transport maps to its own wire form. socket.io keeps today's `Message` + msgpack + `$` header; MQTT maps to properties plus a bare payload. It is a refactor of the module chain rather than a patch to the MQTT transport, and it is the bulk of the work.

## Decisions

| decision | choice | reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| topic split | three: `req` / `rsp` / `evt` | shared subscriptions require `req` alone; the `rsp`/`evt` split buys least-privilege ACLs |
| default encoding | msgpack, JSON accepted, reply mirrors request | between JSON and protobuf on size and parse cost with no schema toolchain, and implementable on tiny embedded devices carrying a lot of data |
| property names | `mr-` prefixed | collision-proof against broker-injected properties; short because every key rides on every packet |
| migration | default prefix → `msgrpc/v2` | v1 and v2 peers coexist on one broker; a bridge peer can run both |
