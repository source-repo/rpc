/**
 * An msgrpc network as an MCP server, so a model can look at a plant the way a person looks at the
 * console: who is out there, what each one exposes, and call it.
 *
 * MCP is JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, newline-delimited. That is little enough to speak directly, and
 * doing so keeps the CLI free of a second RPC framework - this package is, after all, about not
 * needing one. The consequence is the rule everything here obeys: **stdout carries protocol and
 * nothing else**. A stray console.log corrupts the stream and the client sees a parse error rather
 * than whatever was printed, so every diagnostic goes to stderr.
 *
 * The tools are the console's three verbs rather than one tool per method on the network. A peer
 * set that changes while a model is mid-conversation would mean re-issuing the tool list on every
 * arrival and departure; describe_peer hands over the argument types instead, which is the same
 * information in a form that does not go stale.
