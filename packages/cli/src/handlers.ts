/**
 * Behaviour for a fake that the contract cannot describe: state.
 *
 * `returns` answers the same value every time and `emits` fires on a timer, which covers a screen
 * that needs something to draw. What neither covers is a device that *reacts* - a pump that ramps
 * toward the setpoint it was last given, a batch that will not start twice, a valve that reports
 * closed until something opens it. Those are the behaviours an HMI is actually wrong about, and
 * they need a variable and a method that can read what it was called with.
 *
 * So a script may supply the method bodies, in JavaScript or in Python. Both are **off unless
 * `--allow-exec` says otherwise**, and the reason is worth stating rather than leaving implied:
 *
 * **This runs code the script author supplied, and the flag is the security boundary - not the
 * runtime.** The JavaScript context has no `require`, no `process`, no filesystem and a per-call
 * time budget, which stops a careless handler wedging the process; `node:vm` is documented as not
 * being a security mechanism, and a determined script can get out of it. Python is a subprocess with
 * the privileges of whoever started it and no confinement at all. Both are the right tool for a
 * simulator on a development machine and the wrong thing to reach from a plant network, which is why
 * the container ships without the flag.

 * It still needs a bound. The line below evaluates the source rather than parsing it, so a script
 * can run code at compile time - `(function () { while (true) {} })()` is a valid expression - and
 * an unbounded compile wedges startup instead of a call.
 *
 * But it must not be the call budget. This is the first thing to enter a cold `node:vm` context, so
 * it pays for the context, the compiler and whatever the machine is doing instead of this; 200 ms is
 * a statement about how long a *handler* may hold the process, and charging startup against it makes
 * a correct script fail with `did not compile: Script execution timed out` on a slow machine. That
 * is not a hypothetical - it is what a Windows CI runner did to a two-line arrow function. Python
 * above already has its own number for the same reason, and this is that reason applied to the
