const usage = `source-rpc <command> [options]          --version prints the CLI and library versions

  extract   write the contract described by the source to a file
  check     compare the source against a written contract and fail on a breaking change
  strip     write a decorator-free twin of a source file that Node can run directly - the same
            @rpc marks the contract came from, re-said as runtime calls
  console   browse a live network in a browser: peers, what they expose, calls and events
  broker    run a WebSocket bus: relays between the peers that connect to it, until Ctrl-C
  node      make this machine scriptable from another one, and nothing else, until Ctrl-C
  run       start console, node and serve roles together from one JSON task file, until Ctrl-C
            with no file named it runs ./source-rpc.tasks.json; --init writes one to start from
  mcp       serve the network to an MCP client over stdio: list peers, describe them, call them
            stdio carries the protocol, so it is not for interactive use; --port opens a second
            door over streamable HTTP, so two clients can share one node

  bench     call one method over and over and report what it cost
  diff      compare what two live peers expose, when one of them behaves differently
  serve     stand a peer up from a contract: answers every method, refuses what it would refuse
  record    write what the network is carrying to a file, until Ctrl-C
  replay    send a recording's calls at a peer and compare the answers

  peers                             who is on the network right now
  find      <capability>            who implements a qualified capability, e.g. '@scope/contracts/UiBuilder'
  describe  <peer>                  what one peer exposes
  call      <peer> <ns.method> [a…] call it, and exit 1 if it refuses
  watch     <peer> <ns.event>       stream its events as jsonl until Ctrl-C

                                nothing can script it. The peer must authenticate as that name,

    --host <address>            default 127.0.0.1 for the door; widening it requires the token
                                below, or the server refuses to start
    SOURCE_RPC_MCP_TOKEN        bearer token the door requires; or --mcp-auth <file> naming a
                                file that holds it. Never a flag value: ps is readable by

    --script <file>             canned returns, deliberate failures and events on a timer
    --fail <ns.method=Code>     answer with that RPC error code, repeatable
                                Timeout is the special one: the call is never answered at all
    --allow-exec                let a script supply JavaScript or Python method bodies, so a fake

                                supplied, on this machine. Development only
    --broker / --hub / --prefix / --timeout / --name / --sign as above

  record

    --peer <name>               only frames this peer sent or received

    --no-payloads               leave arguments and results out

  node
    --scripts <dir>             where scripts are kept and run. Required
    --scriptable-by <peer>      who may script this machine, repeatable. Required - a node that
                                names nobody offers nothing to anybody
    --broker / --hub / --prefix / --timeout / --name / --sign as above
                                on a broker, --sign at both ends is what makes the grant work:
                                without it nothing can prove who a caller is and every call is
                                refused
    --grants <file>             what an AI principal may do here, as a grants document. Without one
                                a badged principal may observe and nothing else, which is the
                                default everywhere. SIGHUP re-reads it, so a grant can be closed
                                without stopping the node

  run [<file.json>]             defaults to ./source-rpc.tasks.json, in this directory only
    shared network settings and console, node or serve tasks; relative paths are resolved from the
    task file. Each task's credentials are its own: a key file under 'sign', an auth file under
    'auth', or the same secrets written inline in either. Full format:
    https://source-repo.github.io/rpc/tools/cli#task-files
    --init                      write a task file to start from, with three roles and fresh signing
                                secrets, and refuse to write over one that exists. --broker, --hub
                                and --scriptable-by fill in what they name

  strip <file…>
    --out <dir>                 where each decorator-free twin lands, under the same file name.
                                Required, and refused when it would overwrite the input: the
                                decorated source stays the one you edit. Line numbers are
                                preserved, so a stack trace from the twin reads against the source

  broker
    --port <n>                  default 7843, or 8843 with --cert
    --host <address>            default 127.0.0.1, so a bare broker serves this machine only;
                                --host 0.0.0.0 is what puts the bus on the network, and it says
                                what that means when it does
    --cert <file> --key <file>  serve WSS rather than WS; moves the default port to 8843
    --name <peer>               how the broker identifies itself, default broker-<three words>
    --upstream <url>            join another broker, repeatable; the two become one network
    --auth <file>               tokens to accept, and the one to present upstream; without it the
                                bus relays for anyone that can reach the port
    --quiet                     do not log peers arriving and leaving

  ports
    7843 rpc          7844 console          the plaintext pair
    8843 rpc-tls      8844 console-tls      the same two with a certificate
                                --cert and --key move a server to its encrypted port on their own,
                                so the convention holds without anyone remembering the number

  --auth <file>                 bearer tokens, for every command above
    { "token": "…",             presented when this command dials a hub that authenticates
      "tokens": {               accepted when this command is the bus: token -> the peer it admits
        "…": "plantServer",
        "…": { "name": "hmi", "roles": ["operator"] } },
      "derive": "…",            on a node: the secret it mints credentials with for the scripts it
                                starts, so each one connects as itself and the node's own token
                                never reaches a script's environment
      "issuers": {              on a bus: which nodes it lets vouch for the programs they start
        "node-a": "…" } }       issuer peer name -> the same secret that node derives with
    SOURCE_RPC_TOKEN            the same "token", for a container
    SOURCE_RPC_TOKENS           the same "tokens" as JSON, for a container
                                never a flag: ps is readable by everyone on the box
