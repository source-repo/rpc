/**
 * Who has come and gone.
 *
 * A peer that flaps is one of the commonest faults on a plant and the hardest to catch in the act:
 * the console showed it as a dot that changed colour and then forgot, so a device dropping every
 * thirty seconds looked exactly like one that was simply up. The console keeps the history and
 * hands it over when a page connects, so opening the console after the trouble still shows it.
