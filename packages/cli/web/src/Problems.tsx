 * What has gone wrong on the console's links.
 *
 * The transports have always emitted these four and nothing ever listened, so a call that never
 * came back looked the same as a network with nothing on it. Between them they cover every way an
 * answer fails to arrive: a frame refused before the RPC layer, one with nowhere to go, a name two
 * peers are both answering to, and a link that failed underneath.
 *
 * Unlike the traffic tap there is nothing to switch on. These cost nothing when nothing is wrong,
 * and the ones worth reading are usually from before anyone thought to look - so the console keeps
 * a bounded history and hands it over when the page asks.
