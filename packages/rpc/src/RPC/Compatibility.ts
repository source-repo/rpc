/**

 * Validating an old call against its own old schema would prove nothing: it still reaches the
 * current implementation, so acceptance would only move the failure from the validator into the
 * method body. What the stored history is actually good for is comparing the two contracts and
 * asking whether every call the old one permitted is still one this one handles.
 *
 * That is ordinary function subtyping. Parameters are contravariant - the current contract has to
 * accept everything the old one allowed, so widening a parameter is safe and narrowing it is not.
 * Returns are covariant - everything the current contract can return has to fit what the old
 * caller expects, so narrowing a return is safe and widening it is not.
 *
 * The check is conservative: where it cannot prove compatibility it reports incompatibility, since
 * a false "safe" is the expensive direction.
