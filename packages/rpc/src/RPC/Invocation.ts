 * The per-invocation handle, injected as a method's final parameter when it opts in with

 * AsyncLocalStorage surface would work in Node and silently degrade in a page that hosts real
 * services, and the house style is explicit everywhere else - `$with`, declared semantics,
 * capture-by-listing.
 *
 * The parameter never exists for callers: the proxy type strips it from the visible signature and
 * the extractor omits it from the wire schema, so the remote contract is exactly the method
 * without it. What it exists for is the question a handler could not answer before: *who is
 * actually calling* - which is why `from`-style parameters were spoofable, and are now display
 * data at most.

 * Strips a trailing RpcInvocation from a method type - the caller-visible signature is the method

 * handle but is not one, and stripping it would silently shorten an honest signature.
 *
 * `NonNullable` is what admits the handle when it is declared optional, which it has to be on any
 * method whose last real parameter is optional - TypeScript refuses a required parameter after one,
 * so `tap(filter?: Filter, invocation?: RpcInvocationHandle)` is the only spelling available there.
 * It does not widen the trap: `NonNullable<unknown>` is `{}`, which is not a handle, so a trailing
 * `unknown` is still left alone in both its required and its optional form.
