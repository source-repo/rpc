 * and every hop is a register-then-snapshot subscription delivering full frames, so a duplicate
 * or a replay is harmless and a lost one is repaired by the next.
 *
 * The public lifecycle vocabulary is the adopted one: `initializing | live | stale | missing |

 * has not answered yet. `stale` keeps its narrow meaning - same mount, freshness unknown - and a
