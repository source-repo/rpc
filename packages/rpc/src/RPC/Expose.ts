/**
 * How calls into one exposed instance may overlap.
 *
 * When nothing is declared, the default is graded by what each method says it does. A `query` runs
 * as it arrives, and a method declaring `idempotent-command` or `non-repeatable-command` semantics
 * is serialised per instance - command state is exactly what interleaving corrupts, where
 * `setMode('manual'); start(); setSetpoint(80)` from one caller lands inside `stop();
 * setMode('automatic')` from another and leaves a machine in a combination neither asked for, and
 * the contract already names which methods command. A method that declares nothing keeps the old
 * behaviour and runs in parallel: guessing that an unmarked method is safe to serialise would be
 * the same mistake as guessing it is safe to repeat.
 *
 * `parallel` forces every call to run as it arrives, declared commands included - the opt-out for
 * a re-entrant design. `serial` runs one call at a time per exposed instance, whatever the methods
 * declare. A function instead runs one call at a time per key it returns, which is how a server
 * fronting many devices keeps each device's commands in order without serialising the whole server
 * behind the slowest one.
 *
 * **A serialised method must not call back into its own queue over RPC.** The second call waits
 * behind the first, which is waiting for it. The deadline being read after the queue wait means
 * the pair unwinds as a caller Timeout and an expired refusal rather than hanging forever - loud,
 * but still wrong. A design that re-enters declares `execution: 'parallel'` and does its own
 * coordination.

 * What kind of power a method exercises, as opposed to whether it may be repeated.

 * them was a real bug in an earlier design: `deployProgram(bundle)` and `setSetpoint(value)` can
 * both be honest `idempotent-command`s, and an AI principal permitted to adjust a setpoint must not
 * thereby be permitted to deploy a program. Semantics decide retry; effect decides which authority
 * a caller needs to have been granted.
 *
 * - `observe` reads and changes nothing a caller could notice.
 * - `operate` changes the world the way an operator does: setpoints, modes, acknowledgements.
 * - `program` changes what the system *is* - deploying, editing, starting or removing programs,
 *   contracts or logic. The distinction that matters most, because its blast radius is unbounded.
 * - `security-admin` changes who may do any of the above.
