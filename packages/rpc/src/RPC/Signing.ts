 * bytes that are themselves covered - so altering it could make the payload fail to parse but never
 * change what was authorised. **That reasoning is wrong**, and the counterexample is one byte long:
 * `0x31` decodes as the JSON text `"1"`, which is the number 1, and as a MsgPack positive fixint,
 * which is the number 49. Both parse. Both verify. Flipping one unsigned property therefore changed
 * a signed setpoint from 1 to 49 with the signature still good.
 *
 * The same argument applies to anything else the receiver acts on rather than merely transports: the
 * error code decides what a caller does about a failure, the declared contract version decides
 * whether the call is accepted at all, the response topic decides where the answer is published, the
 * ttl decides whether the method runs at all, the idempotency key decides whether it runs again, and
 * the owner fence decides whether it runs under an ownership the caller never observed. All six are
 * covered.
 *
 * The MQTT message expiry is deliberately **not** covered, because the broker is meant to decrement
 * it in flight and a signature over it would break on the first queued message. Nothing is lost:
 * expiry may only narrow the signed ttl, never extend it, so rewriting it can delay or drop a frame
 * - which anyone able to rewrite it could do anyway - but cannot buy a stale command more time.
