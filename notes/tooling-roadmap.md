# Tooling roadmap

What the CLI and console could become as a tool for testing and debugging a network of devices. Written after a pass over the existing commands and a look at what MQTT monitoring tools (MQTT Explorer, mqtt-spy, `mosquitto_sub -v -t '#'`) actually give people.

Ordered by what unlocks the most for the least. Nothing here is committed to; it is a list of what is missing and what it would cost.

## Where it stands

Five commands — `extract`, `check`, `console`, `broker`, `mcp` — and one service, `ConsoleService`, with five verbs: `peers`, `describe`, `call`, `watch`, `unwatch`.

Two observations from pointing the MCP server at a live network:

- **The broker is indistinguishable from a broken device.** `plantBus` appears in the peer list like anything else, and describing it gives `ClassNotFound: msgrpc.describe is not exposed` — the exact answer a real device gives when someone forgot `exposeIntrospection`. Nothing says "switchboard".
- **The console sees only its own traffic.** It shows calls it made and events it subscribed to. Traffic between two other peers is invisible to it, which is most of the traffic on a real network.

---

## 1. Headless verbs — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

There is no way to call a peer from a shell. `console` needs a browser, `mcp` needs a model on the other end, and CI has neither.

```
source-rpc peers      --hub http://bus:8080 [--json]
source-rpc describe   <peer> [--json]
source-rpc call       <peer> <namespace.method> [args...] [--json]
source-rpc watch      <peer> <namespace.event>          # jsonl until Ctrl-C
```

`ConsoleService` already does all of this; the verbs are that logic without the HTTP server, plus exit codes so a failed call fails a build. Arguments are coerced against the peer's own contract — `describe()` first, then the method's `params` decide whether `1200` is a number or a string — with a JSON-else-string fallback when no contract is published.

This is the prerequisite for most of what follows: smoke tests in CI, a bash loop hammering a device, `jq` over an event stream.

## 2. The traffic tap — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

The MQTT-monitor feature, and the one thing the console genuinely cannot do. **Turned on at runtime on a running broker rather than by restarting it with a flag** — a plant bus that has to be restarted to be observed will not be observed.

Shipped: `bus.tap/untap/taps` on the broker, `TransportEvent.relayed` in the library, call/reply pairing with latency, filters by peer/namespace/kind, payloads off by default, taps that expire. Both backends are built — the broker hook for socket.io, the wildcard subscription for MQTT (on its own connection, so overlapping subscriptions can never double-deliver a request). The console exposes `tap`/`untap`/`taps` over both and the page has a Traffic tab.

Closed since: a tap now records the peer that opened it, and the console releases it when that peer goes — a page is a peer on the console's own listener, so a closed tab takes its tap with it instead of leaving one running for up to five minutes. The ttl remains the backstop for an opener that left without a goodbye.

The blocker this section used to record — *"tying a tap to the peer that opened it would need the caller's identity inside the method, which the RPC layer does not hand over today"* — stopped being true when the invocation handle shipped: `RpcInvocationContext` carries `source` and `identity`. What actually stood in the way was narrower and took a while to find. `tap(filter?)` ends in an optional parameter, TypeScript refuses a required parameter after one, and both the extractor and `WithoutInvocation` demanded the handle be exactly `RpcInvocationHandle` rather than the `| undefined` an optional declaration produces. Widening the filter to `TapFilter | undefined` instead is the tempting way out and a breaking contract change — `check` says so, and it is right, since a caller that sent nothing would suddenly be one argument short. Both places now admit the optional form without admitting a trailing `unknown`, which is what the bidirectional test was there to keep out.

### Shape

The broker gains one namespace, `bus`:

```
bus.tap(filter?)      -> a token; frames start arriving as `bus.frame` events
bus.untap(token)
bus.taps()            -> who is tapping what
```

`filter` narrows by peer (either direction), namespace, or message kind, so "mirror everything `plantServer` says and hears" is one call. Subscribers are ordinary msgrpc event subscribers, so the console, the CLI's `watch`, and the MCP server all get it for free.

### The tension worth naming

The broker currently exposes nothing, deliberately: *"a peer addressing the broker by name gets `ClassNotFound`, which is the truth — it is a switchboard, not a service."* Exposing `bus` makes that sentence false, and it cannot be gated behind a start-up flag without reintroducing the restart this is meant to avoid.

So: the namespace is always there, and the broker's startup warning grows a line. Anyone who can connect to an unauthenticated broker can already impersonate any peer, so tapping is not a new class of exposure — but it is a much more convenient one, and it should be refusable through the existing `authenticate`/`relay` machinery rather than a flag of its own.

### Implementation

Two backends, one concept:

- **socket.io** — `SocketIoServerTransport.forward()` is the single point every relayed frame passes through. The tap is a hook there. This is the one that matters for the "add it to the live broker" case.
- **MQTT** — no broker of ours to hook, so the tap subscribes `<prefix>/rpc/+` (v1) or `<prefix>/{req,res,evt}/+` (v5) and decodes. The transport is already shaped for this: `MqttTransport` takes a `topic` option documented as "peer name to subscribe as", `topicAddressee()` already parses the addressee out of a topic, and there is a comment about watching a topic "on their behalf". It needs its own subscribe path rather than `topic: '+'`, since `isSafeTopicSegment` deliberately rejects wildcards.

### Why it beats a generic MQTT monitor

Those tools hand you a MsgPack blob on a topic. This knows what a frame is, so it can pair `POST` with `SUCCESS`/`ERROR` by correlation id:

```
14:32:07.114  console-one → plantServer   plant.writeSetpoint(1200, 'auto')
14:32:07.156  plantServer → console-one   ok 42ms
14:32:09.001  plantServer => *            plant.alarm('pressure high', 2)
14:32:11.400  hmi-3       → plantServer   plant.read()
14:32:21.400  plantServer → hmi-3         Timeout 10000ms
```

On a signed network the tap still sees everything: signing wraps frames, it does not encrypt them. Worth saying in the docs before someone assumes otherwise.

## 3. A problems panel — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

All four transport reports — `rejected`, `unroutable`, `peerDisplaced`, `transportError` — now reach a Problems tab and `console.problems`, kept in a bounded history so a page opened after the trouble still sees it. Each peer also carries the link it was found on.

It did **not** explain item 9 below: the flakiness did not reproduce while the panel was watching, and six healthy loads produced no reports at all. Worth retrying the next time it happens, which is the whole point of the history being there.

## 4. A fake peer from a contract — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

`source-rpc serve --contract plant.types.json`, with `--script` for canned returns, deliberate failures and timed events, and `--fail ns.method=Code` as the shorthand. `Timeout` never answers at all.

Building it turned up a gap in the library: a method had no way to choose its error code, so every throw reached the caller as `Exception` and fault injection could not stage `Unauthorized`. Errors carrying a code the protocol defines are now honoured.

Still open: a mode that varies its answers over time. Deterministic was the right default - a fake you cannot assert on is not a test fixture - but an HMI being demonstrated wants a reading that moves, and `--script` cannot express that.

## 5. Record and replay — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

`source-rpc record --out session.jsonl` and `source-rpc replay session.jsonl --against deviceUnderTest`, exiting 1 on any difference.

Building it turned up the same race twice more: opening a tap and issuing the first call both happened before presence had arrived, so a recorder found an empty network and a replay spent its first call waiting out a timeout. Both now settle first, as the verbs already did. Worth watching for anywhere else that acts immediately after `ready()`.

Not built: replaying events at a device, which would be a different thing - sending a device its own output back. Recorded, though, so a later comparison could use them.

## 6. Contract conformance against a live peer — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

`check` today is source-vs-file. Add peer-vs-file:

```
source-rpc check --peer plantServer --against plant.types.json
```

Call `describe()` on the device and run the same `namespaceProblems` comparison. Answers "is this device running the firmware we think it is". Every piece exists; this is the wiring.

Sibling: `source-rpc diff <peerA> <peerB>` for "why does cell 3 behave differently from cell 2".

## 7. Bench — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

```
source-rpc bench plantServer plant.read --rate 20 --for 60s
```

p50/p95/p99 and an error breakdown. `call()` already returns `ms`; the console shows it once and discards it. Finding the device that falls over at 10 calls a second is a real plant problem.

## 8. Console polish — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

Mostly the feature set MQTT monitors have converged on, and mostly missing:

- **Event stream: filter, pause, export.** Capped at 200 in memory, no filter, no pause, args `JSON.stringify`d onto one line with no expand. The Traffic tab has the first three; the Events tab still has none of them.
- **Latency kept per method** across the session, plus a "call it 100 times" button.
- **Call history with re-run**, and a **copy as CLI** button — pairs with the verbs above.
- **Saved argument presets** per method. Switching peers loses everything typed.
- **Watch all events on this peer** in one click.
- **Peer role labels** — broker / console / page / device — so a switchboard does not read as a broken node. A broker could advertise itself in presence; failing that, infer it from `describe` failing while the peer demonstrably relays.
- **Presence timeline.** A Presence tab, kept by the console and handed over on connect, so a page opened after the flapping still sees it. A peer that has arrived three times or more in the window is called out by name, since that is the fault and the rest is a Tuesday.
- **Saved argument presets** per method, in the browser. Keyed by namespace and method rather than by peer, so a set saved against one cell is offered on the next - which is the case that matters, the reason to save a setpoint sequence usually being that five more cabinets are coming. Named by what they hold, so there is no dialog to name them in.
- **Peer role labels** - broker / console / page / device. The worry was that telling them apart needs a describe per peer, a round trip each on a network where the peer list is the cheap part. It does not: the console already describes a peer when someone selects it and when it goes looking for a bus to tap, so the label is recorded from descriptions already being made. Peers name themselves as the network is used, and an idle console still costs what it always did.

## 9. Somewhere to put a contract, and something to start from it — done in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

Anders' idea. The design that fell out is better than the sketch: the answer to "where do the files go" turned out to be **that they do not have to**. `start_fake` takes a contract inline and stands a peer up in-process, so there is no file and no process to manage; `save_contract` exists for when you want one on disk to commit or to hand to the CLI, and appears only when `--contracts` names a directory.

The guard worth remembering: a fake refuses a name a peer already answers to. Displacing a live device with a stand-in that agrees with everything is the worst thing this could have done.

Still open: a model cannot yet record or replay from MCP. `watch_traffic` covers looking; capturing to a file would need the contracts-directory treatment.

## 10. The page sometimes fails to reach the console on load — found and fixed in msgrpc-cli 2.5.0

**Leaked connections, and the browser's per-host limit.**

The page opened an `RpcServer` and closed it in React's effect cleanup, which does not run when a document is torn down by a navigation. So every page that was navigated away from left its connection behind for the console to reap on a timeout, and in the meantime remained a peer: in everyone's list, still receiving the events it had subscribed to. Five stale pages after five reloads was the ordinary shape of a debugging session, and it was visible the whole time in the console's own peer list without anyone reading it as a fault.

socket.io connects over HTTP long-polling, so each of those held a long-lived GET against the console's origin. Chrome allows six concurrent connections per host. Five ghosts plus a new page's handshake is exactly six, so the new page's poll queued behind requests that would not return, and `console.on` timed out at ten seconds having never been sent.

That accounts for all of it: browser-only, because nothing outside a browser has that cap - a Node client doing the same three subscriptions over the same link succeeded 12 times out of 12. Roughly one load in two, depending on whether a ghost happened to expire in time. Worse on rapid reloads, because ghosts accumulated faster than the console reaped them. And the console stayed responsive to the CLI throughout, since a separate process has its own connection pool.

The fix is a `pagehide` listener that closes the server on the way out - it covers navigation, tab close and the back/forward cache, where `unload` is unreliable and increasingly ignored. Ghosts now disappear as the page leaves: three loads left five stale peers before, and none after. Thirteen consecutive rapid loads connected where roughly half had been failing.

The page also retries the handshake three times before giving up, so if this is ever provoked some other way the console recovers instead of sitting there with an error and an empty peer list - which is a poor answer from the thing you opened to find out what was wrong.

Not built: forcing the websocket transport, which would sidestep the per-host limit entirely. The polling fallback exists for networks that block websockets, and the leak was the actual defect.
